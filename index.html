    <h1> From Lost to Found </h1>
  
<p> Hey there, lovely people! I'm Ramona, and I'm about to take you on a whirlwind adventure through my rollercoaster of a life. Buckle up, because it's been a wild ride! </p>

<p> 
    For as long as I can remember, I was lost in the maze of life. Picture me wandering through a labyrinth, trying to find my way while juggling the responsibilities of being a young, single mom. Survival mode was my middle name—I did whatever it took to provide for my little tribe. Passion fueled my every move, but as time went on, I found myself sinking into a pit of boredom and despair. Surely, there had to be more to life than just going through the motions.

<p> 
    Now, here's the twist: I discovered that my true calling lay in helping people unleash their inner superheroes. It was both a blessing and a curse because, while I reveled in empowering others to achieve their full potential, I hadn't quite figured out my own superpower or identified what made me truly shine.

    I had been a problem-solving wizard, concocting nifty solutions for small businesses and tackling everyday hurdles through office products. But it was like a bolt of lightning struck my brain—I realized that I needed to level up my game and transform my problem-solving prowess into crafting working apps and software. The epiphany hit me like a blast of inspiration: I could become a software engineer and bring my ideas to life!
And so, my friends, I'm embarking on a thrilling quest to become a full stack developer. Cue the dramatic music and prepare for an epic tale of learning, growth, and unearthing hidden talents! I'm all fired up to harness the power of technology, design innovative applications, and make a genuine impact on the world around me.
